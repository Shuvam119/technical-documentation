# What is a Static Site?

A static site is a collection of pre-built web pages delivered to users exactly as stored on the server. Unlike dynamic websites, static sites don't rely on server-side processing, making them faster and more secure. They are composed of fixed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Using Static Sites for Documentation

Static sites are ideal for documentation because:

- **Fast**: No need for backend processing.
- **Simple**: Content is easy to maintain with Markdown.
